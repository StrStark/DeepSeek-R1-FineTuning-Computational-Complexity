For example, in 2d circuits where n ∼D2, the sampling overhead scales exponentially in D2 rather than in D. Note that this still does not guarantee an overhead exponential in V as in Eq.",

The 2/d factor accounts for the fact that each layer extends the support only in one of the d dimensions, but in both the positive and negative directions along that dimension.
