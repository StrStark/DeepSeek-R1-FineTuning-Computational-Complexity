A language L belongs to PΠ according to the loose access mode if and only if it belongs to PΠ according to access through a consistent language. Proof. The “only if” direction is trivial since a consistent language is a particular case of a black box. For the “if” direction, consider M• from the deﬁnition of access through a consistent language.",
