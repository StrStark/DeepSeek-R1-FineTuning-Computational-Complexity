Thus, by Corollary 2, a generic instance of the 13-point problem with rational coordinates has Galois group S28. Since Gal(π4) ⊴S28, we deduce that gw(π4) = 28 as well. The decomposition used in the proof of Theorem 9 was also used in [50] to devise an efficient homotopy continuation solver for the minimal radial camera reconstruction problem.",
