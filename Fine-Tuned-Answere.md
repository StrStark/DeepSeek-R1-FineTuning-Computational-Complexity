theory, which can be used to test AI systems.

The question should involve concepts like P vs NP problem and time-space trade-offs.

Certainly! Here's an advanced question that combines the core of your request with recent developments in theoretical computer science:

**Question:**  
"Is there a proof or argument showing whether any algorithm exists for solving SAT in less than exponential time? If such algorithms exist, what is their fundamental reason?"

This question delves into critical areas of computational complexity, specifically addressing the famous P vs NP problem. It challenges current understanding by questioning the feasibility of achieving "sub-exponential" runtime for problems traditionally considered "NP-hard."
